# Goal #
The goal of this project is to design a new, modern and portable SOCR web-app that demonstrates the concepts of statistical resampling, randomization and probabilistic simulation, which is purely based on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript framework. The implementation of this project demands platform portability, computational efficiency, usability (complete functionality via user-friendly modern interface), extensibility and ease of documentation, support and servicing to the entire community.
